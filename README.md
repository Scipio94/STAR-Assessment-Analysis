# STAR Assessment Analysis

## Objective

The Head of Schools is interested in examining the following key questions:

1. Determine the percentage of students At Benchmark or Above Benchmark by grade and teacher
   - Is there a specific grade level that needs more support?
   - Is there a correlation between certain teachers and the likelihood of students being At or Above Benchmark?
   

2. Are there any trends between general education students and students receiving special education services?

3. Does poor attendance or chronic absenteeism (missing 10% or more of school days) impact studentsâ€™ STAR performance?

4. What next steps would you take to help develop a strategy for improving regional performance?
